    Sakurai-Sugiura method, paralleled generalized eigenpair solver on
    MPI parallelism.

    Sakurai-Sugiura method uses contour integration and complex moment
    to computes eigenvalues located inside a contour path on the
    complex plane.

    ====================================================================

    In this implementation, it splits given communicator `comm` into `n`
    lower size sub-communicators `scomm`s (with size `ss = s / n` where
    `s` denotes the size of `comm`, hence `n` should be a factor of `s`)
    to compute each complex moment parallelly.

    The matrix `a` and `b` in general eigenvalue problem `ax = Î»bx`
    could be either numpy's ndarray or any matrix format distributed on
    `scomm`, but user should define matrix loaders `l_a` and `l_b` to
    load matrix after spliting `comm` into `scomm`, and matrix-matrix
    multiplication `cv` on `scomm`.

    User should also defined the solver `solver` of block linear equation
    `ax = v` on `scomm`, where the whole `v` on `scomm` is with shape
    (N, l), and is with shape (N / ss, l) on each node on `scomm`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    l_a : Callable object with type `l_a(scomm: MPI_Comm) -> (N, N) array_like`
        Matrix Loader of matrix `a` where `a` is a complex or real square
        matrix with shape (N, N) in the generalized eigenvalue problem.
    l_a : Callable object with type `l_a(scomm: MPI_Comm) -> (N, N) array_like`
        Matrix Loader of matrix `b` where `b` is right-hand side square matrix
        with shape (N, N) in the generalized eigenvalue problem.
    contour : pyss.util.contour.Curve
        The contour where the eigenvalues we desired located inside.
        `contour` is the instance of pyss.util.contour.Curve, which contains
        the imformation of contour path.
    l : Integer
        Size of source matrix. The whole source matrix is with shape (N, l)
        on `scomm`. And is with shape (N / ss, l) on each node of `scomm`.
    m : Integer
        Number of complex moment.
    n : Integer
        Number of quadrature points of numerical integrations. The
        approximation error of numerical integration is inverse proportion
        to `n`.
    solver : Callable object with type
        `solver(a: matrix, v: ndarray, scomm: MPI_Comm) -> ndarray`.
        The solver of linear equation `ax = v` in communicator `scomm`,
        where `a` is the matrix given by user, `v` is a ndarray with
        shape (N / ss, l), and `ss` is the size of `scomm`. Notice that
        solver should return the same data type and same shape to `v`.
    cv : Callable object with type
        `cv(c: (N, N) array_like, v: ndarray, scomm: MPI_Comm) -> ndarray`.
        The function of multiplying of matrix `c` and matrix `v` on `scomm`,
        where `c` is the matrix loaded by either `l_a` or `l_b`, and `v` is
        ndarray with shape (N / rank, l) on each node of `scomm`.
        The return value of `cv` should be a ndarray, and with the same shape
        of `v`.
    comm : MPI_Comm
        MPI communicator. The size of `comm` should be a factor of `n`.

    Returns
    -------
    w : (n,) array, where n <= M
        The eigenvalues.
    vr : (n, N) array, where n <= N
        The right eigenvectors. Each eigenvector vr[:,i] is corresponding to
        the eigenvalue w[i].
